    "A team of marine biologists from Antarctica recently discovered group of penguins floating in the sea on an ice floe.  They have no idea where they are from or what species they are, so the scientists are depending on you for help.  Your mission is to help them decide what species the penguins are from **given only measurements of their culmen length and depth**.  Your approach to the problem will be to use the Palmer penguin dataset to build the best darn kNN classifier that you can using 5-fold cross validation to decide its hyperparameter.  Use as many code cells as you need, and use a plot to show results that let you choose the hyperparameter.  Good luck!"
