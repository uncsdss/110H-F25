To help everyone wrap their head around it better, you're going to \"play\" the game (and then help implement it later in Python in HW6!)  For lab today, there is a great website that let's you play, with cute graphical goats and everything!  And it keeps track of your results (nice graphical plot!), which you'll report below. You can easily play 20 or 30 times in just a couple minutes, so don't spend more than 5 minutes playing (But the goats! Yes, we know, they're very cute.).\n",
